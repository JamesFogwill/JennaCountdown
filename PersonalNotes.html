                    Hey Jenna, so this is basically a pour your heart out section. I can add to this over time and eventually you will end up with a HUGE ego and a lot of bollocks from me lol.

                    For the first installment i'll just say this. Even though your; such a blonde, bad at games, totally not independant despite consantly saying you are, a little whiny and the ligthtest weight I have ever seen. Your also funny, cute, positive and im so comfortable around you after a short period of time. We both want to live on a beach, are both hot as hell and both terrible at singing. You make me smile at my phone when texts come through and stay up till 2:30 to just talk and play games. I miss you everyday because you show me what im missing. You have done something to me Jenna and I cant wait to talk to you about what that is when we see eachother! Bye for now baby x.

                    Happy one month baby! What can I say about the past month, I seem to have this annoying gf that distracts me every day. You stop me from working even when we dont facetime because my mind is always on the london trip, the cruise or some plan or thing or call i want to do or have with you. You cant cook, face it your going to loose the cook off, and I gotta stay up till 2 in the morning to talk because you live in America. The thing is though, its not like you make me stay up (that wouldnt work anyway), I just want to stay up. Whenever I think about you its always happy memories and feeling of anticipation to our next meet. Plus I can just teach you how to cook! So yeah, I can see myself doing another month of this ;) I wanna say the odds of us meeting were really low and that we are so lucky, but I just know you would of found me eventually... I might have even found you. See you soon and missing you always! - James x
